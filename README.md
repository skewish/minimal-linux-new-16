Minimal linux new 16 (newmin16) is a simple, 16 step recipe to create a minimal linux system which, in theory, could be expanded to a fully operational system.
However, it's intended purpose is more of a tutorial to experience the basics of compilation.
I've also found it to be an excellent test-bed for hacking the linux kernel.
Once complete, you should get a prompt and be able to execute binaries.
It's very simple and fun.
Be sure to follow the instructions and always backup important software before beginning.
