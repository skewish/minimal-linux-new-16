This doccument is a simple recipe to create a minimal linux system which, in theory, could be expanded to a fully operational system.
However, it's intended purpose is more of a tutorial to experience the basics of manipulating code and compilation.
I've also found it to be an excellent test-bed for hacking the linux kernel.
Once complete, you should get a prompt and be able to execute binaries.
It's very simple and fun, but be sure to follow the instructions and always backup your important software before beginning.
