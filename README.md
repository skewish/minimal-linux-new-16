Minimal-linux-new-16 (newmin16) is a simple 16 step recipe to create a minimal linux system which, in theory, could be expanded to be fully operational.
However, its intended purpose is more of a tutorial to experience the basics of compilation and kernel modification.
Once complete, you should get a prompt and be able to execute binaries.
It is very simple and fun.
Just follow the instructions and backup important software before beginning.
